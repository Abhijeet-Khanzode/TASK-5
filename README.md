# Task 5: Wireshark Packet Capture & Analysis

## Objective:
Capture and analyze live network packets using Wireshark.

## Tools Used:
- Wireshark

## Steps:
1. Started Wireshark and captured on the Wi-Fi interface.
2. Opened a website and pinged `google.com` to generate traffic.
3. Stopped the capture after 1 minute.
4. Filtered by protocols: HTTP, DNS, and TCP.

## Protocols Identified:
- **DNS**: Domain resolution queries and responses.
- **TCP**: Connection-based packets (3-way handshake observed).
- **HTTP**: Webpage requests and responses in plaintext.

## Output:
- Uploaded `.pcap` file with traffic capture.
- Screenshots (optional): Attached for filtered protocols.

## Skills Gained:
- Protocol filtering
- Packet-level analysis
- TCP/IP understanding
